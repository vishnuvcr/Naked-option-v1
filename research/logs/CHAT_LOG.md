# Research Conversation / Decision Log

## 2026-10-07

### User request

Test every plausible method for predicting NIFTY 50 direction, for both intraday and positional trading, while restricting the eventual strategy to naked long call/put buying. User requested invention of new metrics/models/rules and an exhaustive research effort.

### Developer decision summary

- Interpret “every possible way in the universe” as a finite pre-registered method universe that is broad, reproducible and exhaustively covered, not literal infinite/unbounded search.
- Keep intraday and positional research separate.
- Do not use option-selling strategies as the final strategy family.
- Include global/NSE/BSE inefficiencies, option data, FII/DII, volatility, sentiment, macro/cross-market information and execution frictions where relevant.
- Require developer/tester gates and immutable logs.
- Preserve failed methods as research results.
- Never claim a result exists before it has been run and independently verified.

### Prior-project continuity recovered from Project artifacts

Earlier project artifacts reported:
- next-day direction model on an untouched holdout: AUC about 0.458, accuracy about 48.2%;
- 5-session volatility expansion prediction: AUC about 0.688;
- an apparent directional trading rule failed stronger CPCV/robustness testing;
- option-surface/skew information remained an interesting signal.

Those are prior findings to be revalidated, not accepted as current conclusions.


### 2026-10-07 — Resume research command

User requested that the research resume from the current checkpoint. Developer re-read the Phase 2 status, research plan/protocol, method registry, error/research logs and both developer/tester branch status ledgers before continuing. Phase 2 remains the active gate; no prediction/strategy phase is allowed to start until data/PIT validation is passed.

Current automated run: Phase 2 Data Audit run #60 is executing on `phase-02-developer`. Official NSE legacy/UDiFF acquisition, schema validation, snapshot generation and HF acquisition have already completed in this run; the reconciliation stage is still executing. Prior real-run failures were preserved and corrected rather than bypassed.
