## 2026-10-07 — Phase 2B derived spot-data correction

- The revised LastPric corroboration threshold passed the practical price gate, but the workflow then stopped because the HF source did not contain usable spot values for the selected date/expiry.
- This is a secondary-source field-availability issue, not evidence that the option-price source is invalid.
- The reconciliation now reports the spot check explicitly as PASS/FAIL/unavailable and never forward-fills or fabricates a spot value.
