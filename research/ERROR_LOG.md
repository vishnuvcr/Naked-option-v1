# Error Log

## 2026-10-07 — Phase 6 Run 37668947725
- Category: implementation/runtime
- Component: scripts/run_phase6_novel.py intraday cutoff construction
- Symptom: AttributeError: 'DatetimeIndex' object has no attribute 'iloc'
- Location: line 616 at commit 85c1b8db633dc1fb79f3426ab0b065e068efc2aa
- Impact: empirical suite terminated before artifact creation; no metrics accepted.
- Root cause: invalid positional indexing API for pandas DatetimeIndex.
- Correction: use DatetimeIndex[...] and add explicit regression coverage.
- Prevention: tester approval required before fresh empirical execution.

## 2026-10-08 — Phase 6 fresh run 575 residual cutoff defect
- Category: implementation/runtime
- Component: scripts/run_phase6_novel.py later global-I03 cutoff path
- Symptom: residual use of `decision_times.iloc[rows[0]]` on a pandas DatetimeIndex remained after the earlier cutoff correction.
- Location: commit 9b9b7914f82993505ec4f2f0c3aac0b3d6732521, current file line 721.
- Impact: fresh hosted run 575 (37678088131) is classified as non-evidence because the same AttributeError would occur when the global-I03 path is reached; no metric may be accepted.
- Root cause: incomplete search/coverage of all DatetimeIndex positional accesses during the prior correction.
- Proposed correction: replace the residual access with DatetimeIndex[...] and add regression coverage plus a source-level assertion forbidding `decision_times.iloc`.
- Prevention: tester approval is required before the developer branch is advanced for a fresh empirical run.

## 2026-10-08 — GitHub live-log visibility error during Phase 6 run 575
- Category: infrastructure/tooling
- Component: GitHub Actions live-job log retrieval
- Symptom: fetching logs for in-progress empirical job 112986961991 returned HTTP 404 BlobNotFound.
- Impact: no scientific impact; live job-step status remained available through the workflow-jobs endpoint.
- Disposition: infrastructure-only visibility issue; no metric or result was inferred from missing logs.

## 2026-10-08 — Developer tooling edit attempt
- Category: developer/tooling
- Symptom: first detached-commit construction attempt failed due to a JavaScript template-literal escaping error while assembling the multi-file tree.
- Impact: no repository change; the intended correction was not written by that failed call.
- Disposition: corrected in the subsequent repository operation; no scientific impact.

## 2026-10-08 — Developer detached correction indentation defect
- Category: developer/code assembly
- Component: proposed detached Phase 6 correction commit `1aa8be846348f9e8341d572cd3289cd12ee89045`
- Symptom: the corrected `cutoff = decision_times[...]` line was initially emitted at the wrong indentation level because the replacement omitted the source line's existing leading whitespace.
- Impact: the proposed detached commit was rejected before tester submission; developer branch was not advanced and no workflow was triggered by this flawed object.
- Correction: rebuilt the detached commit with the cutoff line correctly nested inside the `if intraday:` block.
- Prevention: inspect the exact changed source lines in the detached commit before tester review.

## 2026-10-08 — Phase 6 run 578 regression arithmetic defect
- Category: tester/regression-fixture arithmetic
- Component: scripts/test_phase6_novel.py global-I03 cutoff regression
- Symptom: regression expected `decision_times[4] - 120 minutes` to equal 11:00, but the fixture starts at 09:15 with hourly spacing, so decision_times[4] is 13:15 and the correct result is 11:15.
- Hosted run: Research Protocol Check #578 (`37680279189`), job `112994273676`.
- Impact: mandatory regression failed; empirical job was skipped; no Phase 6 artifact or metric was generated/accepted.
- Root cause: arithmetic error in the newly added regression expectation, not in the production cutoff implementation.
- Correction: update the expected timestamp to 11:15 and preserve the production change unchanged.
- Prevention: independently recompute fixture timestamps for every explicit time-delta assertion before the next hosted run.

## 2026-10-08 — Phase 6 Run #581
- No execution error occurred. Protocol, regression, empirical suite, schema validation and artifact upload all passed.
- The independent tester nevertheless recorded a scientific caution: raw maxima across 140 executed cells are not treated as discoveries because multiple-comparison and downstream trading gates remain outstanding.

## 2026-10-08 — Phase 7 Run #600 workflow dependency failure
- Category: infrastructure/workflow
- Component: `.github/workflows/phase-07-ensemble.yml`
- Symptom: regression job failed at `pip install -r requirements.txt` because the repository has no root requirements.txt.
- Hosted run: Research Protocol Check #600 (`37716619573`), job `113114446777`.
- Impact: regression suite skipped; empirical job skipped; no Phase 7 metric or artifact generated.
- Root cause: Phase 7 workflow incorrectly assumed a repository-level requirements file instead of following the established explicit dependency installation used by Phase 6.
- Correction: install numpy, pandas, scikit-learn and pyarrow explicitly and add canonical cached-data restoration/acquisition steps.
- Disposition: non-evidence infrastructure failure; tester gate `research/gates/PHASE7_RUN600_WORKFLOW_FAILURE_TESTER.md` = REQUEST CHANGES.

## 2026-10-08 — Phase 7 Run #608 regression harness defect
- Category: regression/test-harness
- Component: `scripts/test_phase7_ensemble.py`
- Symptom: `NameError: __file__ is not defined` when executing the production module source via `exec()`.
- Hosted run: Research Protocol Check #608 (`37716925536`), regression job `113115445197`.
- Impact: regression assertions did not execute; empirical job was skipped; no Phase 7 artifact or metric was generated.
- Root cause: synthetic namespace omitted the production module's `__file__` variable.
- Correction: supply deterministic `__file__` and assert the initialization path.
- Disposition: non-evidence; tester gate `PHASE7_RUN608_REGRESSION_TESTER.md` = REQUEST CHANGES.

## 2026-10-08 — Phase 7 Run #608 P07 fixture defect
- Category: regression/test-fixture
- Component: `scripts/test_phase7_ensemble.py` P07 causal stacking test
- Symptom: fixture asserted all predictions through row 219 were NaN, although rows 200-219 have exactly 200 prior observations and satisfy the frozen training minimum.
- Impact: the corrected harness would have failed its own P07 boundary assertion; no new hosted execution was authorized from that faulty fixture.
- Correction: require NaN only for rows 0-19 and finite predictions for rows 200-219.
- Disposition: tester gate `PHASE7_RUN608_REGRESSION_FIXTURE_APPROVAL_TESTER.md` = PASS.

## 2026-10-08 — Phase 7 Run #614
- Category: regression/test-harness
- Hosted run: Research Protocol Check #614 (`37717431486`), regression job `113117063695`.
- Symptom: the developer branch at run time still contained the unfixed `ns={}` execution namespace, causing the same `NameError: __file__ is not defined`.
- Impact: regression failed; empirical job skipped; no artifact or metric accepted.
- Root cause: approved corrections had not yet been applied to the actual developer branch when Run #614 started.
- Correction: applied directly to the live developer branch with commit `84ffd525cc3ae77571a0cb38d24047b3de7b473e`.
- Disposition: non-evidence; fresh hosted verification required.

## 2026-10-08 — Phase 7 Run #622 regression signature defect
- Category: regression/test-harness
- Component: `scripts/test_phase7_ensemble.py` family-bootstrap call
- Symptom: `TypeError: family_bootstrap() takes 4 positional arguments but 5 were given`.
- Hosted run: Research Protocol Check #622 (`37717651173`), regression job `113117787284`.
- Impact: regression failed after reaching numerical tests; empirical job was skipped; no Phase 7 artifact or metric was accepted.
- Root cause: regression fixture retained an obsolete `blocks` argument after the production function signature was simplified to `(y, candidates, baseline, block_len)`.
- Correction: remove the stale argument and add a signature assertion.
- Disposition: non-evidence; tester gate `PHASE7_RUN622_REGRESSION_TESTER.md` = REQUEST CHANGES.

## 2026-10-08 — Phase 7 Run #635 detector sequencing issue
- Category: workflow trigger sequencing
- Hosted run: Research Protocol Check #635 (`37719802712`).
- Symptom: protocol and detector jobs passed but `phase7-ensemble-gated` was skipped.
- Root cause: the Run 628 tester approval gate was archived before the detector-path commit, so the current push diff contained only workflow changes and no allowed Phase 7 science-path file; the detector intentionally uses the immediate push diff to decide whether to launch.
- Impact: no regression or empirical execution; no scientific result; Run #635 is non-evidence.
- Correction: use a harmless, non-scientific test-file comment after the approved detector correction to trigger the gated workflow.

## 2026-10-08 — Phase 7 Run #637 repeated horizon-capture defect
- Category: developer branch-lineage / production data-mapping
- Hosted run: Research Protocol Check #637 (`37719955436`), empirical job `113125225580`.
- Symptom: `KeyError: ('2','E01')` after regression passed; the hosted branch still contained `H=horizons[0]` in `capture_scope`.
- Root cause: the previously approved horizon-capture correction was not present in the branch commit used for Run #637; later detector/trigger commits were based on an older lineage.
- Impact: no Phase 7 artifact or scientific metric; Run #637 is **NON-EVIDENCE**.
- Correction: reapply the exact tester-approved current-horizon binding on the current branch and retain direct multi-horizon regression coverage.
- Prevention: verify production diff against the tester-approved correction commit before every gated empirical trigger.

## 2026-10-08 — Phase 7 Run #645 closure regression defect
- Hosted run #645 (`37723044460`) failed regression with `UnboundLocalError` because `H=H` was placed inside the nested capture hook.
- Tester requested an explicit `current_h=H` closure binding.
- A first automated reconstruction was malformed by indentation and was discarded before branch advancement.
- The current correction rebuilds `capture_scope` explicitly with correct scope and `try/finally` restoration.

## 2026-10-08 — Phase 7 Run #650 tester findings
- Artifact `11532515562` was complete but not final evidence.
- Family bootstrap was non-overlapping rather than the frozen moving-block bootstrap.
- P08/P09/P10 regime diagnostic list had one extra terminal entry at daily +10 relative to candidate chronological metric blocks.
- Tester froze the correction rules before implementation.


## 2026-10-08 — Phase 7 Run #654 audit closure
- Category: audit/scientific validation
- Hosted run: Research Protocol Check #654 (`37763242007`).
- Symptom: no runtime or workflow error; all mandatory jobs completed successfully and the immutable artifact was uploaded.
- Independent audit findings: all 100 candidate cells executed; arithmetic/schema checks passed; corrected moving-block bootstrap and regime-diagnostic reconciliation matched the frozen correction gate.
- Statistical disposition: none of the ten layer/horizon family tests produced a p-value below 0.05; no Phase 7 candidate is promoted.
- Scoped audit restrictions recorded by the tester: P05/P06 chronological diagnostics are full-series rather than trade-only, and the intraday P08/P09/P10 regime inputs are computed on the one-minute causal path at hourly decision rows; neither may be tuned from Run #654 outcomes.
- Disposition: **PASS WITH SCOPED RESTRICTIONS**. Run #654 is accepted technical evidence; downstream option execution, cost, robustness and fresh-forward gates remain mandatory.


## 2026-10-09 — Phase 7 reference artifact manifest test fixture failure
- Category: regression/test fixture
- Component: scripts/test_phase7_reference_artifact.py and run_phase7_ensemble.write_reference_manifest.
- Hosted runs: #835 (37912125332), #837 (37912165684), #838 (37912206197); the first and follow-up attempts failed the new regression step before the empirical job. Run #831 (37912024282) is non-evidence for the new artifact because it started before the tester gate was archived.
- Symptom: `ValueError` from `aggregate_path.relative_to(ROOT)` because the manifest test's second temporary directory remained under `/tmp`, outside repository ROOT.
- Root cause: the first fixture path was moved under `data/reports`, but the second fixture occurrence was not updated in the same edit.
- Correction: update the second temporary-directory call to use `dir=ROOT / "data" / "reports"` in commit `14d20380632e365b2a0b6b63afe58f2775375950`.
- Prevention: search all occurrences of fixture constructors after scripted edits and ensure manifest paths obey production path assumptions. A fresh hosted run must pass before accepting the output contract.

## 2026-10-09 — Phase 7 reference artifact regression correction verified
- Hosted run: Research Protocol Check #852 (`37912587739`), developer head `ac6b30090e5146d527bb0af6dd9352a9b6a7fc93`.
- Result: original Phase 7 regression and new reference-artifact regression both PASS; tester authorization gate PASS.
- The prior fixture defect is considered corrected for this code path. Earlier failed runs remain non-evidence and are not overwritten.
- Empirical execution is still in progress; artifact integrity and scientific acceptance remain pending separate tester audit.

## 2026-10-09 — Phase 7 reference artifact runs remain active without artifacts
- Category: workflow/runtime observability; root cause not yet established.
- Components: GitHub Actions runs #852 (37912587739), #924 (37914896724), and #925 (37914905848), empirical job `python scripts/run_phase7_ensemble.py`.
- Symptom: repeated live polls show all three workflow runs and empirical jobs still `in_progress`; no artifacts are listed. Run #852's run metadata remains stale at 09:39:25 UTC. Live log requests for active jobs have returned `BlobNotFound`.
- Impact: immutable reference panels and manifest are unavailable for audit, so no new Phase 7 results can be accepted and Phase 8 remains blocked.
- Evidence classification: unknown/still running; do not label as success or failure based only on missing logs or stale metadata.
- Immediate prevention: do not spawn additional competing empirical runs. Reconcile the first completed attempt and inspect its artifact. If execution remains unbounded, amend the workflow with explicit job timeout and periodic progress checkpoints after tester review; ensure failure uploads diagnostics and partial outputs are clearly marked non-evidence.


## 2026-10-09 — Phase 7 Run #925 independent empirical tester REQUEST CHANGES

- Category: protocol/metrics/inference implementation
- Component: `scripts/run_phase7_ensemble.py` and independent artifact audit
- Hosted empirical run: [Run #925](https://github.com/vishnuvcr/Naked-option-v1/actions/runs/37914905848), immutable source commit `682eadf2a9eb4de250bc3db27d02e57f88687fa1`.
- Tester audit workflow: [Run #943](https://github.com/vishnuvcr/Naked-option-v1/actions/runs/37935031119).
- Symptom: corrected independent audit recorded 2,775 passed checks and 323 failed checks across 10 panels. The failures cluster into four root causes, rather than 323 separate defects.
- Root causes: P10's frozen abstention range [0.45, 0.55] is missing from the production abstention registry; NaN volatility/trend inputs are classified as low/low regime state; P05/P06 chronological diagnostics ignore candidate abstention masks; family-bootstrap differential vectors treat non-evaluable rows as zero for abstaining candidates.
- Impact: metrics and inferential outputs are not reconciled to the frozen Phase 7 specification. Run #925 is **NON-ACCEPTED EVIDENCE**; no Phase 7 metric, model or strategy is promoted, and Phase 8 stays blocked.
- Tester disposition: `research/gates/PHASE7_RUN925_EMPIRICAL_TESTER.md` = **REQUEST CHANGES**; the independent tester report is archived in this developer branch without modifying scientific implementation.
- Required correction: fix the four findings and add tests for P10 interval edges, finite regime-state eligibility, candidate-consistent block metrics, and missing-versus-zero bootstrap differential semantics. Do not change the frozen research specification, registered candidate universe, horizons, seed, block lengths, 500 bootstrap replications or thresholds.
- Prevention: tester code approval is mandatory before a fresh empirical run; a new immutable artifact must pass independent source/hash/metric/family reconciliation before phase progression.


## 2026-10-09 — Stale Phase 7 code approval allowed premature empirical workflow dispatch

- Category: workflow authorization/orchestration
- Component: `.github/workflows/research-protocol.yml` and `.github/workflows/phase-07-ensemble.yml`.
- Symptom: the pre-Run-925 `PHASE7_CODE_APPROVAL_TESTER.md` file was treated as sufficient empirical authorization after a newer tester report had issued REQUEST CHANGES. Separately committing the production correction and its regression tests triggered multiple workflows before the correction-specific gate was added.
- Affected runs: [Run from correction commit](https://github.com/vishnuvcr/Naked-option-v1/actions/runs/37935752265) and [run from correction plus tests](https://github.com/vishnuvcr/Naked-option-v1/actions/runs/37935794939). They started empirical jobs without tester review of the corrections and are **NON-EVIDENCE**, regardless of completion/artifacts. No result from either run may be selected or used for inference.
- Root cause: caller authorization depended on a stale approval file's existence and the reusable workflow checked only the older artifact-output code review, not the correction-specific gate.
- Correction: all current/manual/automatic Phase 7 empirical paths now require `research/gates/PHASE7_RUN925_CORRECTION_CODE_TESTER.md` to contain both `Decision: PASS WITH SCOPED RESTRICTIONS` and `fresh empirical execution only`. The validator/test changes remain under independent review; the fresh-run gate is intentionally absent pending tester approval.
- Limitation: the connected GitHub operations do not expose an Actions-cancel operation, so already-started jobs could not be stopped through this session. They are explicitly classified as non-evidence; subsequent workflows use the stricter gate.
- Prevention: batch source/test/workflow changes before a single commit where practical; make all empirical authorization decisions correction-specific and require the newest independent tester PASS at both the caller and reusable-workflow layers.


## 2026-10-09 — Tester REQUEST CHANGES: correction approval not bound to exact code snapshot

- Category: workflow authorization/gate integrity
- Component: `.github/workflows/research-protocol.yml` and `.github/workflows/phase-07-ensemble.yml`.
- Tester review: `research/gates/PHASE7_RUN925_CORRECTION_REVIEW_TESTER.md` = **REQUEST CHANGES**.
- Finding: the correction-specific tester PASS is currently checked only by file presence and two text phrases. It is not tied to the exact approved source/test/validator/spec/workflow snapshot. A future protected-code commit could inherit a stale PASS and trigger empirical execution.
- Impact: no new Phase 7 empirical execution is authorized, and Phase 8 remains blocked.
- Required fix: embed the exact reviewed commit plus hashes for protected files in the correction approval manifest; both automatic and manual workflow paths must verify those hashes before authorization. Add positive and negative tests (matching snapshot authorizes; changed protected file rejects).
- The earlier attempts `37935752265` and `37935794939` remain NON-EVIDENCE. The reviewer confirmed the four scientific code corrections and hosted regression, but withheld approval because of this workflow-safety flaw.
