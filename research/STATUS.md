## Phase 5 current state

- Frozen protocol tester review passed at `research/gates/PHASE5_PROTOCOL_TESTER.md`.
- Independent tester issued REQUEST CHANGES for the early correction lineage; those submissions are archived under `research/gates/`.
- Protocol amendment for intraday refit cadence was independently passed at `research/gates/PHASE5_PROTOCOL_AMENDMENT_TESTER.md`.
- Intraday Family D now refits once per 20 trading sessions and predicts on the frozen hourly decision grid.
- The previous Family D runs that failed regression or empirical execution are rejected evidence and are not used for selection.
- Latest correction lineage is on `phase-05-developer`; hosted Family D run #16 (`37606785909`) is in progress after the tester-approved exact sequence-cache optimization.
- Phase 6 remains blocked until the independent tester reviews an immutable Family D artifact and issues a gate decision.

## Research continuity rule

A failed family or model is not a terminal conclusion. The full finite pre-registered universe, option economics, transaction-cost stress, multiple-testing controls and untouched-forward validation must be completed before final synthesis.
