## Phase 5 current state

- Frozen protocol tester review passed at `research/gates/PHASE5_PROTOCOL_TESTER.md`.
- Independent tester issued REQUEST CHANGES for the early correction lineage; those submissions are archived under `research/gates/`.
- Protocol amendment for intraday refit cadence was independently passed at `research/gates/PHASE5_PROTOCOL_AMENDMENT_TESTER.md`.
- Intraday Family D now refits once per 20 trading sessions and predicts on the frozen hourly decision grid.
- The previous Family D runs that failed regression or empirical execution are rejected evidence and are not used for selection.
- Hosted Family D run #16 (`37606785909`) is preserved as non-accepted evidence because the frozen D07 wording did not exactly match the calibrated-meta-stack implementation. Tester gate `research/gates/PHASE5_D07_POST_AMENDMENT_TESTER.md` authorized fresh execution. Hosted run #19 (`37611880308`) has passed the mandatory regression gate and is currently executing the empirical D01-D15 suite. No metric is accepted yet.
- Phase 6 remains blocked until the independent tester reviews an immutable Family D artifact and issues a gate decision.

## Research continuity rule

A failed family or model is not a terminal conclusion. The full finite pre-registered universe, option economics, transaction-cost stress, multiple-testing controls and untouched-forward validation must be completed before final synthesis.


## Live verification — 2026-10-07
- Family D hosted run #19 (37611880308): **CANCELLED — NON-EVIDENCE**.
- Active step at cancellation: empirical D01-D15 execution.
- Regression suite: **PASSED**.
- Result schema validation: **SKIPPED**.
- Immutable artifact upload: **SKIPPED**.
- Family D empirical acceptance: **NONE**.
- Phase 6: **BLOCKED** pending independent tester artifact audit.

## Run #20 tester gate
- Run #20 (`37626101730`): workflow success; artifact `phase5-family-d-results` created.
- Independent tester found intraday D13-D15 had n=0 for every registered horizon because 20-observation session-local windows were built on the hourly decision matrix.
- Run #20 is non-evidence. Tester gate `research/gates/PHASE5_RUN20_INTRADAY_SEQUENCE_TESTER.md` requests changes.
- Developer correction maps causal 20-observation representations from the full 1-minute path to the frozen hourly decision rows.
- Tester approved the correction in `research/gates/PHASE5_RUN20_INTRADAY_SEQUENCE_APPROVAL_TESTER.md`.
- A fresh hosted Family D run is required; Phase 6 remains blocked pending artifact audit.


## 2026-10-07 — Family D run #23 final technical gate

- Fresh hosted run #23 (`37642007846`) on developer head `75ed6ddd90ac261364bf52570999d3c308fb37b5` completed successfully.
- Immutable artifact `phase5-family-d-results` / artifact ID `11499450561` was independently downloaded and SHA-256 verified as `27ca6cbc6e1653d40e2d896a81211c97a8d5e70543cf37ad9f402597eee306d8`.
- Independent tester gate `research/gates/PHASE5_FAMILY_D_RUN23_TESTER.md` = **PASS WITH SCOPED RESTRICTIONS**.
- All 150 Family D method/horizon cells executed; numerical reconciliation passed; D07 leakage/isolation checks passed; intraday D13-D15 coverage is restored and non-zero at every registered horizon.
- No Family D model is promoted. Multiple-testing, option economics, transaction costs, robustness and fresh-forward validation remain mandatory.
- Phase 6 remains pending only for independent tester review of the developer's proposed scope.


## 2026-10-07 — Phase 6 implementation gate
- Frozen Phase 6 method specification was approved by the tester.
- Developer implemented E01-E10/I01-I10, added causal/numerical regression tests, and created a gated workflow.
- The empirical workflow job is blocked unless the tester approval file is present on the developer branch.
- No Phase 6 empirical metric has been generated or accepted.
