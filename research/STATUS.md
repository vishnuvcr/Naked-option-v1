## Phase 5 current state

- Frozen protocol tester review passed at `research/gates/PHASE5_PROTOCOL_TESTER.md`.
- Independent tester issued REQUEST CHANGES for the early correction lineage; those submissions are archived under `research/gates/`.
- Protocol amendment for intraday refit cadence was independently passed at `research/gates/PHASE5_PROTOCOL_AMENDMENT_TESTER.md`.
- Intraday Family D now refits once per 20 trading sessions and predicts on the frozen hourly decision grid.
- The previous Family D runs that failed regression or empirical execution are rejected evidence and are not used for selection.
- Hosted Family D run #16 (`37606785909`) is preserved as non-accepted evidence because the frozen D07 wording did not exactly match the calibrated-meta-stack implementation. Tester gate `research/gates/PHASE5_D07_POST_AMENDMENT_TESTER.md` authorized fresh execution. Hosted run #19 (`37611880308`) has passed the mandatory regression gate and is currently executing the empirical D01-D15 suite. No metric is accepted yet.
- Phase 6 remains blocked until the independent tester reviews an immutable Family D artifact and issues a gate decision.

## Research continuity rule

A failed family or model is not a terminal conclusion. The full finite pre-registered universe, option economics, transaction-cost stress, multiple-testing controls and untouched-forward validation must be completed before final synthesis.


## Live verification — 2026-10-07
- Family D hosted run #19 (37611880308): **CANCELLED — NON-EVIDENCE**.
- Active step at cancellation: empirical D01-D15 execution.
- Regression suite: **PASSED**.
- Result schema validation: **SKIPPED**.
- Immutable artifact upload: **SKIPPED**.
- Family D empirical acceptance: **NONE**.
- Phase 6: **BLOCKED** pending independent tester artifact audit.
